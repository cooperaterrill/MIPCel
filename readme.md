# Overview

This is a low-level processor simulation in pure Excel (so, no VBA). It is a simplified version of MIPS32 and supports the most basic instructions. I might make write an interpreter so you can write assembly for this.

## Usage
Use F9 to iterate calculations. Memory is shown in blue towards the bottom.
